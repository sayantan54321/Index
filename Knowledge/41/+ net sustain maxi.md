Net Sustain is a sustainability initiative by Net-a-Porter, a luxury online fashion retailer, aimed at promoting eco-friendly fashion choices. The concept encompasses a selection of clothing products that prioritize ethical sourcing, sustainable materials, and responsible production processes. When discussing the "maxi" in the context of clothing products, it generally refers to maxi dresses or maxi skirts—long, flowing garments that extend to the ankles or even the floor.
