The term "cami maxi" generally refers to a type of dress that combines elements of a cami top (cami is short for camisole) with the length and style of a maxi dress. Here’s a detailed overview of cami maxi dresses in the context of clothing products:

### 1. **Design and Structure**
   - **Bodice Style**: A cami maxi typically features a fitted or relaxed bodice similar to a camisole, with thin straps or spaghetti straps that give it a feminine and delicate appearance.
   - **Maxi Length**: The dress extends to the ankles or floor, making it a long dress. This length is favored for both casual and formal occasions, providing versatility in style.
   - **Material**: Cami maxis are commonly made from lightweight, breathable fabrics such as cotton, rayon, chiffon, or jersey. These materials contribute to the dress's comfort and flowy nature.

### 2. **Versatility**
   - **Occasions**: Cami maxi dresses can be worn in a variety of settings, from casual outings to formal events depending on the fabric, print, and accessories. They can be dressed up with heels and statement jewelry or dressed down with sandals for a more relaxed look.
   - **Seasonality**: Due to their airy design, cami maxis are particularly popular in warmer seasons. However, they can also be layered with cardigans, jackets, or warm accessories for cooler weather.
