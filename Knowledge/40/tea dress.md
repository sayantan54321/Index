A tea dress is a style of feminine clothing that has a long history and is primarily associated with day wear, particularly for afternoon events or gatherings. The term "tea dress" originated in the early 20th century and is linked to the British tradition of afternoon tea, which was a social occasion for women to gather, typically involving light refreshments and casual conversation.

### Characteristics of a Tea Dress:

1. **Silhouette**:
   - Tea dresses typically feature a fitted bodice and a flowing skirt that falls to just below the knee or mid-calf. The silhouette is designed to be flattering and comfortable, allowing for ease of movement.

2. **Fabrics**:
   - These dresses are often made from lightweight, breathable fabrics such as cotton, linen, or chiffon. The materials are usually soft, sometimes with a slight sheen, which enhances the femininity of the garment.

3. **Design Elements**:
   - **Necklines**: Common necklines include scoop, V-neck, and round necks. Some designs may also feature higher necklines or delicate details like lace or embroidery.
   - **Sleeves**: Tea dresses can come with various sleeves, including cap sleeves, short sleeves, three-quarter sleeves, or sleeveless designs.
   - **Waistline**: They often have an empire waist or natural waistline, sometimes accented by belts, sashes, or gather details to emphasize the waist.
   - **Prints and Patterns**: Floral prints are particularly popular for tea dresses, but plaid, polka dots, and other patterns can also be seen. Solid colors are also acceptable, often in pastel or muted tones.

4. **Length**:
   - The hem of a tea dress typically falls between the knee and mid-calf, striking a balance between formality and casualness.
