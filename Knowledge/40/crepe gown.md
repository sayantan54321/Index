A crepe gown is a type of dress characterized by its use of crepe fabric, which is known for its unique texture and drape. Crepe fabric is produced by twisting and weaving fibers in a specific manner, creating a slightly crinkled surface. This results in a lightweight, flowing material that often retains its shape beautifully while providing a comfortable fit.
