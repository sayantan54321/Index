### 1. **Material**:
   - **Cotton Poplin**: This type of fabric is made from 100% cotton or a cotton blend and is known for its fine, crisp texture. Cotton poplin is lightweight, breathable, and has a smooth finish, which makes it comfortable to wear, especially in warmer weather. The fabric also holds its shape well and resists wrinkling, making it an excellent choice for dresses.

### 2. **Design Features**:
   - **Midi Length**: The midi dress typically falls between the knee and mid-calf, providing coverage while offering a sophisticated silhouette. The midi length is flattering on a variety of body types and is suitable for both casual and formal occasions.
   - **Silhouettes**: Cotton poplin midi dresses can come in various styles, including A-line, wrap, shirt dress, and fitted designs. Each silhouette can accentuate different aspects of the figure and fit a range of personal styles.
   - **Sleeves and Necklines**: Options vary widely, including sleeveless, short sleeves, long sleeves, or three-quarter lengths. Necklines can range from crew to V-neck, off-the-shoulder, or even halter styles.

### 3. **Color and Patterns**:
   - **Solid Colors**: Cotton poplin dresses often come in solid hues, from neutral shades to vibrant colors, allowing for easy mixing and matching with accessories.
