   Jersey dresses come in various styles, including but not limited to:
   - **A-Line**: Fitted at the top and flares out at the bottom, flattering various body types.
   - **Bodycon**: Snug-fitting and designed to emphasize curves, often worn for a night out.
   - **Shift**: Straight-cut, loose-fitting design that offers a relaxed silhouette.
   - **Maxi**: Long-length dress that reaches the ankle, suitable for casual and semi-formal occasions.
   - **Midi**: Falling between the knee and ankle, midi jersey dresses offer a balance of elegance and comfort.
   - **Wrap**: Features a wrapping design that cinches at the waist, providing adjustable fit and accentuating the waistline.
   - **T-shirt Dress**: A simple, casual style resembling an oversized t-shirt, often with short sleeves.
