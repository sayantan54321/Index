A stretch mini dress is a versatile and stylish piece in the realm of women's fashion, designed to fit closely to the body while providing comfort and ease of movement. Here are detailed aspects of stretch mini dresses in the context of clothing products:

### 1. **Fabric Composition**
   - **Material**: Typically made from blended fabrics featuring a high percentage of elastane (spandex) mixed with cotton, polyester, or viscose. This combination allows the dress to stretch and fit snugly while maintaining its shape.
   - **Stretchability**: The core feature of stretch mini dresses is their ability to expand and contract with the body, providing comfort without restricting movement. The elastane content generally ranges from 5% to 10% depending on the desired fit.

### 2. **Design Features**
   - **Length**: As the name suggests, mini dresses are designed to fall above the knee, offering a youthful and flirty silhouette. The length can vary based on fashion trends and personal preferences.
   - **Fit**: Stretch mini dresses often feature a bodycon design that hugs the body. This style accentuates curves and can be flattering for various body types.
   - **Necklines**: Common necklines include crew, V-neck, off-the-shoulder, and sweetheart, allowing for a range of looks from casual to evening wear.
   - **Sleeve Options**: They can come in various sleeve styles, including sleeveless, cap sleeves, long sleeves, and even bell sleeves, giving diversity in style.
