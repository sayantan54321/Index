A sequin mini dress is a fashionable and eye-catching garment typically designed for women, featuring a short length that usually ends above the knee. It's often characterized by its shimmering surface, which is created by the application of sequins—small, shiny, disc-like pieces made from various materials like plastic, metal, or even glass. Below is a detailed description of sequin mini dresses, including their features, styles, uses, care, and where to find them.
