A tiered dress is a garment characterized by its multiple layers or tiers, which are generally arranged in a cascading fashion from the bodice down to the hem. This style creates a flowing, dynamic appearance that can enhance movement and provide visual interest. Tiered dresses can vary significantly in design, fabric, length, and overall style, making them versatile for various occasions.

2. **Materials**:
   - Tiered dresses can be crafted from a variety of fabrics, including cotton, chiffon, linen, silk, or synthetic blends. The choice of fabric impacts the dress's overall look and feel, with lighter fabrics offering a more ethereal quality, while heavier materials may provide structure.

### Care and Maintenance

Depending on the fabric, tiered dresses may require specific care instructions:
- **Machine vs. Hand Washing**: Some may be machine washable, while others, particularly silk or chiffon, may require gentle hand washing or dry cleaning.
- **Ironing**: Due to the layered design, itâ€™s essential to iron them carefully, ensuring not to flatten the tiers.
