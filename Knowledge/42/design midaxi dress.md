A midaxi dress is a versatile and stylish garment that falls between a midi and a maxi dress, typically reaching down to mid-calf or just above the ankle. The design of a midaxi dress can vary widely depending on style, fabric, and intended use. Below, I detail various aspects of midaxi dress design in the context of clothing products:

### 1. **Silhouette and Length**
   - **Length:** The defining feature of a midaxi dress is its length. It typically skims the middle of the calf, allowing it to accentuate the legs while still providing coverage.
   - **Silhouette:** Midaxi dresses can come in various silhouettes including A-line, straight, wrap, and fitted styles. The silhouette chosen plays a significant role in how the dress flatters different body types.
