A tiered maternity maxi dress is a stylish and comfortable clothing option designed specifically for expectant mothers. These dresses combine practical elements of maternity wear with fashionable aesthetics, allowing pregnant women to feel confident and comfortable throughout different stages of their pregnancy.

### Key Features of Tiered Maternity Maxi Dresses:

1. **Design and Silhouette**:
   - **Maxi Length**: Typically ankle-length or floor-length, providing full coverage and comfort.
   - **Tiered Design**: The "tiered" aspect refers to multiple horizontal layers or ruffles that create a flowing silhouette. This design allows for ease of movement and accommodates a growing belly.
   - **Empire Waist**: Many tiered maternity maxi dresses feature an empire waistline, which sits just below the bust. This design flatters the figure and allows room for the belly to expand.

2. **Fabric and Comfort**:
   - **Soft, Stretchy Materials**: Common fabrics include cotton, rayon, jersey knit, and blending materials that provide stretch and breathability.
   - **Soft Linings**: Some dresses may include linings or soft seams to prevent irritation against sensitive skin.
