Maxi dresses are typically ankle-length or longer and are popular for their versatility, comfort, and style. When classified as "sustainable," they align with principles of environmental consciousness, ethical labor practices, and minimal waste.

### Features of Sustainable Maxi Dresses:

1. **Materials:**
   - **Organic Fabrics:** Many sustainable maxi dresses are made from organic cotton, linen, or hemp, which are grown without the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.
   - **Recycled Materials:** Some designs utilize recycled fabrics such as polyester made from post-consumer plastic bottles or recycled cotton, reducing waste and conserving resources.
