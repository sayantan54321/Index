This type of dress can vary significantly in style, fabric, and purpose, making it suitable for various occasions, from casual outings to more formal events. Below are detailed aspects of button front dresses in the context of clothing products:

### 1. **Styles and Cuts**
   - **Shift Dress:** A loose-fitting style that often falls above the knee. It’s easy to throw on and can be dressed up or down.
