   - **Printing and Patterns:** These dresses may use eco-friendly dyes and prints, often inspired by nature or artistic designs, to minimize environmental impact.

### 2. **Materials**
   - **Sustainable Fabrics:** Common materials include organic cotton, Tencel (Lyocell), hemp, Recycled polyester, or other fabrics sourced from renewable resources or recycled materials.
   - **Ethically Sourced Textiles:** Brands may prioritize fair trade practices, ensuring that the workers producing the fabrics are treated fairly and compensated well.
   - **Biodegradable Options:** Some sustainable dresses may incorporate fabrics that are biodegradable, meaning they can decompose naturally without harming the environment.
