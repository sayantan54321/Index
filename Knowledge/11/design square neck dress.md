A square neck dress is a garment characterized by its distinct neckline that features a straight, horizontal cut at the front and typically at the back. This design is flattering for various body types and can be adjusted in length, cut, and fabric for different occasions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its features, types, styling options, and target audiences:

### 1. **Key Features**

#### a. Neckline
- **Shape**: The square neckline creates a bold and structured look, drawing attention to the collarbone and shoulder area. It contrasts with other necklines like V-necks or round necks by offering a more angular appearance.
- **Depth**: Depending on the design, the depth of the neckline can vary, affecting how much skin is exposed.

#### b. Silhouette
- **Fit**: Square neck dresses can come in various fits, including A-line, sheath, fit-and-flare, or empire waist, catering to different body shapes and personal styles.
- **Length**: They can be found in mini, midi, or maxi lengths, each serving different purposes. For example, a mini length may be more casual, while a maxi length feels more formal.

#### c. Material
- **Fabric Options**: Common materials include cotton, linen, polyester, and silk. The choice of fabric influences the dress's drape, comfort, and occasion suitability.
- **Textures**: Designers may incorporate textures like lace, embroidery, or ruffles to enhance the aesthetic appeal.
