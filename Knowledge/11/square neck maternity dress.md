A square neck maternity dress is a type of clothing designed specifically for pregnant women, featuring a square neckline and often providing comfort and style during pregnancy. Here’s a detailed overview of square neck maternity dresses in the context of clothing products:

### Design Features

1. **Neckline**: 
   - The hallmark of a square neck maternity dress is its wide, square-shaped neckline. This design element allows for good support and creates a flattering silhouette, enhancing the natural curves of the body.
  
2. **Silhouette**:
   - These dresses typically have an A-line or empire waist silhouette. The empire waist sits just above the baby bump, allowing for ample room for growth while flattering the figure.
   - The A-line cut helps to create a balanced appearance, skimming over the hips and thighs without being restrictive.

3. **Fabrics**:
   - Made from soft, stretchy materials like jersey, cotton, linen, or blends that accommodate a growing belly while providing comfort.

   - Some dresses may feature lightweight layering or lining for added structure.

4. **Length Options**:
   - Available in various lengths, including mini, midi, and maxi styles. Maxi dresses are particularly popular due to their flowy nature and ease of wear during all stages of pregnancy.
