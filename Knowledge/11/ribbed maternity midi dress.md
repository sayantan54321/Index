3. **Fit**:
   - Designed with a relaxed or fitted silhouette, ribbed maternity dresses often feature side ruching or elasticized panels to adapt to a growing bump.
   - The addition of adjustable elements, such as ties or drawstrings, helps achieve a customized fit throughout the pregnancy.

4. **Functional Elements**: 
   - Many styles include hidden nursing access for ease of breastfeeding after delivery. This feature allows new mothers to continue using the dress post-pregnancy.
