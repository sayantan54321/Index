A sleeve gown is a type of dress distinguished by its incorporation of sleeves, which can vary greatly in style, length, and embellishment. Sleeve gowns are typically characterized by a full or flowing silhouette, and they can serve various occasions, including formal events, weddings, parties, and even casual outings.
