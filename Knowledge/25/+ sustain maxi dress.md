The term "+ Sustain Maxi Dress" typically refers to a specific type of long, flowing dress that is designed with sustainability in mind. While I can't provide details about a specific branded product without additional context, I can describe the general features, materials, and design elements you might expect from a sustainable maxi dress.

### Materials
1. **Eco-friendly Fabrics**: Sustainable maxi dresses are often made from organic cotton, Tencel, linen, hemp, or recycled materials. These fabrics are sourced in ways that minimize environmental impact and often avoid harmful chemicals.
  
2. **Low Impact Dyes**: If the dress features color, sustainable brands may use low-impact dyes that are less harmful to the environment compared to conventional dyeing processes.

### Design
1. **Silhouette**: The classic maxi dress silhouette usually features a long length that reaches the ankles or floor, with a fitted bodice and flared skirt. Options may include sleeveless, short sleeves, or long sleeves.

2. **Versatility**: A sustainable maxi dress is often designed to be versatile, allowing it to be styled for various occasions. It can be dressed up with heels and accessories or down with sandals or sneakers.

3. **Comfort**: Many sustainable dresses prioritize comfort, incorporating features like stretchy waistbands, roomy cuts, or adjustable straps.

4. **Timeless Styles**: Sustainable fashion often emphasizes timeless over trendy pieces. Therefore, you may find classic prints, solid colors, and simple designs that donâ€™t go out of style quickly.

### Ethical Production
1. **Fair Trade Practices**: Brands producing sustainable maxi dresses often focus on ethical manufacturing processes, ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions for all workers involved in the production.

2. **Local Sourcing**: Many sustainable brands aim to source their materials and production locally to reduce transportation emissions and support local economies.

### Care Instructions
1. **Sustainability in Care**: Sustainable clothing may also involve care instructions that promote longevity, such as hand washing or cold washing clothes to reduce water and energy consumption.

2. **Recycler Program**: Some brands offer recycling programs or encourage customers to return clothes at the end of their life cycle to create new products.

### Style Tips
- Pair with a denim jacket for a casual look.
- Layer with a chunky knit for colder months.
