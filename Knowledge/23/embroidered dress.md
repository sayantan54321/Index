   - **Machine Embroidery**: Uses computerized techniques to produce designs rapidly. This method is often used for mass-produced items but can also replicate intricate designs.

2. **Materials**:
   - **Base Fabric**: Common materials include cotton, silk, chiffon, georgette, and linen. The choice of base fabric affects the drape and presentation of the embroidery.

2. **Color Schemes**:
   - **Monochromatic**: Using different shades of a single color can create a sophisticated look.
   - **Contrasting Colors**: Brightly colored threads on a neutral or dark fabric can make the embroidery pop, creating a bold statement piece.

### Care and Maintenance

- **Washing**: Embroidered dresses often require careful washing. Hand washing in cold water is advisable, or using a gentle cycle in the washing machine, depending on the fabric and embroidery.
