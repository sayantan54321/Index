- **Pattern and Color**: Available in a range of solid colors, patterns (like florals, stripes, or abstract designs), and prints, short sleeve maxi dresses can suit both casual and formal occasions.

### **2. Materials** 
- **Fabric Choices**: Common materials include cotton (for breathability and comfort), jersey (for stretch and ease of movement), polyester (for durability and wrinkle resistance), rayon (for a soft touch), and blends (which combine different properties for enhanced comfort).
