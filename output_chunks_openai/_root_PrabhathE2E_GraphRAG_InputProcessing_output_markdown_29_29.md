# Table 4: Recurring and 1-Time Sources & Uses of Funds


The presentation in Table 2 is based on a balanced budget within the tax levy rise constraints of proposition 2 ½, and in compliance with Town Financial Policies requiring recurring costs to be paid for with recurring sources of income. Table 2, line 24, Employee Benefits and Insurance is budgeted up 11.2%, driven by a projected 13% rise in the Town’s cost for employee health insurance for current.
# FY25 Prospective New Recurring Revenue & Needs

**Prospective New FY25 Recurring Revenue**  
$3,712,958  

**Prospective New FY25 Costs**  
- Approved Debt within Levy: -$76,143  

### Hopkinton Public Schools

- 25% Benefits for New School Staff*: -$435,375  
- HPS Contractual Obligations: -$2,635,600  

**Initial School Estimate**  
- Non-School Contractual Obligations: -$500,000  
- **Sum, Prospective FY25 New Costs**: -$5,388,618  
- **Prospective Budget Shortfall**: -$1,675,660  

*Benefits are paid outside the School Budget, but are presented here to reflect staff growth cost.

Again, the prospective new recurring revenue shown in Table 3 is the product of a number of early initial estimates of revenue, and early estimates on the cost to continue health and liability insurance coverage for existing employees. The list of prospective new recurring costs is very likely to grow, perhaps substantially, as the work of the actual budget process progresses.

Table 4 shows that the approach reflected in the tables above, without accounting for any shortfall, would be compliant with all Town Financial Policies, as well as the constraints of Proposition 2 ½.
