# TOWN OF HOPKINTON  
## TOWN MANAGER'S OFFICE  


**TO:** Select Board  
**FROM:** Norman Khumalo, Town Manager  
**RE:** Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Development  
**DATE:** October 5, 2023  

I recommend that you endorse the initial fiscal year (FY) 2025 budget guidance contained in this memorandum, which involves a tax impact of less than 2.5% before consideration of any excluded debt that might be proposed, at your October 10, 2023 meeting.

1. Departments will examine, prepare, and document justification of budgets from the bottom up. Departments will use this opportunity to review current operating approaches, with an eye toward streamlining and improved efficiency of operations. Departments will be prepared to discuss the review of operations for efficiency during upcoming Town Manager Budget Review sessions. The timeline for the budget process is contained in Enclosure (1).

2. Departmental budgets will be submitted to the Select Board, after Town Manager review and recommendation. Consistent with the discussion of prospective sources and uses of funds in Enclosure (2), I request that the Select Board direct that Departmental submissions be developed within the 4.4% spending increase cap that would allow for full compliance with Town Financial Policy under current revenue estimates outlined in Enclosure (2) of this memo, notwithstanding the School Committee’s expression of need which is significantly above that level.

3. Because of the prospective FY25 operating budget shortfall identified in Enclosure (2), budget components under the budgetary direction of the Select Board are directed not to submit any requests for service expansion “new starts” in their budget submissions. Such budget components may send any requests for “new starts” to the Select Board by separate memorandum, via the Town Manager.
