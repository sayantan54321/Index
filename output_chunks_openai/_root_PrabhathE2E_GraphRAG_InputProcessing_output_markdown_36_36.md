Dear All,

As I discussed in the last board meeting on some possible modifications to our Goals framework, I wanted to follow up with a slightly modified framework for establishing strategic goals as below (not for discussion over email).

---

Strategic goals provide a clear direction for the town's growth and development, ensuring that resources and efforts are focused on achieving specific outcomes. We can structure it in 4 key components as below -

## Goal Areas:
Categorize strategic goals into key areas that reflect the town's priorities. Common goal areas include economic development, infrastructure, sustainability, community engagement, education, public safety, and quality of life.

## Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound (SMART) Goals:
Ensure that each strategic goal meets the SMART criteria:

- **Specific:** Clearly define what the goal aims to achieve.
- **Measurable:** Establish metrics to quantify progress and success.
- **Achievable:** Set realistic and attainable targets.
- **Relevant:** Ensure the goal aligns with the town's overall mission and vision.
- **Time-Bound:** Set a specific timeline for achieving the goal.

## Action Plans:
Break down each strategic goal into actionable steps and initiatives. Define who is responsible for each action, the required resources, potential challenges, and milestones. Develop a timeline for implementing these actions.

## Performance Indicators:
Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that will track the progress of each strategic goal. These indicators should provide quantifiable data to measure success and allow for adjustments if necessary.
