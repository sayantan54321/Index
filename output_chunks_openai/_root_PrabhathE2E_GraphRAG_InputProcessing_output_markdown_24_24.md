# Town Revenue Report
## Conclusion
### Net Local Aid experience:


Table 1 rows 6 and 7 estimate a 5.0% increase in local aid from the Commonwealth and a corresponding 5.0% increase in charges for state and regional programs administered through the Commonwealth. Net Local Aid is an important source of funds, contributing 10% of expected net revenue. This estimate reflects a cautious budgeting approach based on both multi-year experience and on the State’s current revenue experience, which is tracking 1.8% below the State’s own planned revenue.

### Net Local Aid experience:

| Fiscal Year | Hopkinton Local Aid | Prior Year State Revenue |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| FY21        | +6.3%                | +4.3%                    |
| FY22        | +10.6%               | +3.4%                    |
| FY23        | +9.9%                | +18.4%                   |
| FY24        | +12.0%               | +4%                      |
| FY25        | +2%                  | trending to +4.6%        |

There is not a tight correlation between overall Hopkinton Local Aid and prior year State revenue, in part because Local Aid is strongly influenced by lagging measures of public school student enrollment. While Hopkinton saw significant growth in Local Aid tied to strong school enrollment growth and to overall increases in education funding in FY22 - FY24, there is not strong evidence to support continuation of that trend into FY25.

Because the State's revenue trend suggests a second consecutive year of low revenue growth for the State, this initial budget cautiously projects a 5% increase in net Local Aid. The actual level of local aid could be higher or lower based on the actions of the new Governor and the Legislature, and will be tracked through the budget process. The municipal financial regulatory framework requires caution budgeting of revenue, and there is an insufficient basis for projecting growth of this source above 5% at this time.
