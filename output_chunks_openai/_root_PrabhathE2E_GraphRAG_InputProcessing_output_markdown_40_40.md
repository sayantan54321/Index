## Work Completed - rounded (does not include every bid item)


Full-depth reconstruction has been completed on both the east and west sides of the project. The sequence of construction to complete the final course of pavement requires the utility work to be completed. With the utility work still delayed, as a result of the unavailability of the Eversource transformers, the final course of pavement will occur next year.
Most traffic and speed limit signs have been placed. The Town has requested that MassDOT remove the second pole from street signs. Street signs will be mounted on single poles. Double signposts should be corrected this year.

Roadway structures to be adjusted down for winter conditions. MassDOT to mark out locations for Amorello to address.
