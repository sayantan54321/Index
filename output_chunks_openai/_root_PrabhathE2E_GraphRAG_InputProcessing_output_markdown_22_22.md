Almost all of the Town's revenue comes from a few sources, most of which have very good prospects over the next budget cycle. As discussed at length in the 2023 Appropriation Committee Report, residential property tax is the Town's dominant revenue source. While the general real estate market is...

# Town Revenue Report

## Overview

The Town's revenue collection is influenced by various factors, including property tax and local aid. Recent trends indicate a cooling in the housing market due to rising interest rates, but this has minimal impact on the Town's property tax collection, which remains stable.

## Property Tax Collection

While property tax collection is solid, new revenue from residential and commercial construction is projected to decrease for FY25. This marks a significant change from previous years when new construction contributed over half of the Town's revenue, aiding in inflationary and service level increases.

## Local Aid

The Town's second largest revenue stream comes from Local Aid from the Commonwealth. Recent estimates suggest a downturn in this area, with overall State revenue trending about 1.8% below projections. This shortfall may affect the Governorâ€™s proposal for local aid.

## Tax Levy Base

On **Table 1**, the Tax Levy Base is projected to rise due to two factors:
1. An increase in the tax base for FY24 from $1,650,000 to $2,464,800, driven by higher residential construction.
2. An increase in valuation from the Eversource Energy Hopkinton liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, which includes a 2.5% statutory increase in the tax levy ($2,150,808).

Since property tax contributes 81% of expected net revenue, it is crucial for the Town's financial health.

### Table 1: Tax Levy Base Projections

| Year | Tax Levy Base Estimate |
|------|------------------------|
| FY24 | $1,650,000             |
| FY25 | $2,464,800             |

## New Growth Projections

On **Table 2**, the projected 5% reduction in New Growth reflects a shift in Town development. With fewer residential and commercial projects in the pipeline, New Growth is expected to contribute only 1.3% of available resources, supporting service growth and inflationary costs.
