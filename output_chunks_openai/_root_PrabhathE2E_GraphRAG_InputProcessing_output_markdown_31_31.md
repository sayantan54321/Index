## Tax Impact

All funding scenarios for the operating budget other than an override of the property tax limits under Proposition 2½ would have a tax increase impact of approximately 2.35% on existing property owners. There will be an additional tax impact, not tied to the FY25 operating budget, of approximately 11.5% in the peak year if the Elmwood School Replacement is approved as debt to be excluded from the tax levy in a Special Town Meeting and subsequent vote in the coming weeks; and there will be additional tax impact not tied to the FY25 operating budget for any Capital Articles approved as debt excluded from the tax levy at the May, 2024 Annual Town Meeting. Information about aggregate tax impact will be developed as part of the FY25 budget process and will be communicated in the Town Manager’s January, 2024 Budget Transmittal and in the Appropriation Committee Report to be delivered in April, 2024.

## Additional Discussion

There are particular economic factors that create higher-than-usual uncertainty with respect to FY25 spending to sustain FY24 service levels. Inflation and economic volatility have been at the highest levels in decades, and that impacts the Town in several specific ways:
- **Wage inflation** - Wages represent about 70% of Town operating spending, and are therefore the most material factor in considering inflation overall. Restated, a 1.4% increase in wages results in a 1% increase in the overall budget. The Town should be mindful that wage inflation is a dominant long-term issue that should be carefully considered when contemplating staff expansions in FY25 or beyond.

- **Energy Cost Escalation** - Although energy is a central factor in many industries, Hopkinton spends approximately 1% of its budget on fuel for vehicles and energy for buildings. Additionally, the Town holds some advantageous contracts for the purchase of energy in the near term, and the Town’s solar installations help buffer energy cost volatility and help dampen the FY25 impact of energy volatility. Energy saving measures through LEED engineering in modern facilities have also improved energy efficiency. However, it is noteworthy that, while local electricity prices have backed off significantly from a peak in February, 2023, electricity costs in August, 2023 were 33% above costs for August, 2020. Energy price volatility remains a budget risk for the Town.
