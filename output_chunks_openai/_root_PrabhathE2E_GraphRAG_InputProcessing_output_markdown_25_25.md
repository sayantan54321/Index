# Town Revenue Report
## Projected FY25 Expenditures


On Table 1 row 9, local receipts (including motor vehicle excise tax) are projected to rise by 5%. This is a noteworthy source of funds, contributing 5% of expected net revenue. This source is dominated by Motor Vehicle Excise Tax. Motor Vehicle Excise Tax receipts were remarkably flat from FY19 to FY23, varying by less than 1% over that entire period. Interest income from Town General Fund deposits was up in FY23, as short term interest rates rose. While higher rates hurt the Town as a borrower, they help the Town Treasury with earnings on deposits placed with the
State-sponsored Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust and with commercial banks. Largely on the strength of the earnings from short term interest from deposits, the Local Receipts category is budgeted up 5% based on current and forecast interest rates.

On Table 1 row 12, Certified Free Cash is one-time funding available to support priorities in the coming year. The exact amount of Certified Free Cash available for use in the FY25 budget will not be known until the end of the calendar year, when the Town’s financial regulators with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certify a specific amount as available. Town Financial Policy calls for paying for recurring expenses with recurring funds. The one-time uses of funds being proposed are detailed in Table 2 (rows 25, 16, 27), and sum to the amount shown on row 12. If more or less than $3.4 million is certified, the amount drawn from Certified Free Cash and spent on one-time expenses can be increased or decreased, within policy guidelines.
