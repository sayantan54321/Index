# Special Town Meeting Timeline


As a foundation to begin Part B of the MassCALL3 grant, I began to engage other communities in forming a regional cluster to prevent youth substance use, which was one of the intentions of the MassCALL Part-A grant. A minimum of 3 communities were needed to be engaged for this purpose. I worked to build relationships with 4 communities and achieved their firm interest in moving forward in a regional cluster.

I have worked closely with my technical assistance provider from the EDC, my supervisor Dawn and others at the Department of Youth and Families in Hopkinton, and the grant management team at DPH to socialize MassCall Part B with the Town Manager, preparing him for a presentation with the Select Board. With my efforts, we were able to achieve the MassCALL Part-B grant, taking the funding from $40,000 annually to $250,000 and increasing the reach of youth prevention beyond Hopkinton’s borders to the region.

I am currently setting up meetings and in communication with the 4 communities in the cluster to develop the MOU’s necessary to move forward to begin our work on the next steps of gathering data and assessing community needs. As the full-time MassCALL3-B Coordinator, I will continue to bring my experience, relevant knowledge, and track record of success to the completion of MassCALL3-B and its future extensions.

Thank you for your time,  
Lauren Mayer Dellelo
