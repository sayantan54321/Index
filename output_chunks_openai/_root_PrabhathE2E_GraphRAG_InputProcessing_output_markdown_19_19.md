## Fiscal Year 2025 Budget
### Initial Discussion Issue Paper
**October 5, 2023**

This paper provides background to support the launch of the fiscal year 2025 (FY25) budget process for the Town of Hopkinton.

Town practice is to complete a review of available funding and a bottom-up budget review of the cost and value of services delivered each year.

The following table summarizes current initial estimates of FY25 General Fund sources of funding compared to budgeted funding estimates for FY24 under a 2.5% tax impact scenario:
