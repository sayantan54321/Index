We wanted to remind the Board that a citizens group prepared the petitions for Town Meeting, and that the TCMC was not involved in that process. While we are happy to participate in future discussions (and two Trails Committee members are petitioners), we feel that it's important that the citizen petitioners be invited to participate in any further discussions regarding the UCTC/UCB.

Finally, with regards to the Trails Committee charge, we wanted to point out the 11 Charges in the original 2019 document have been retained as follows:

- **2023 charge 1** covers old charge #s 6, 8, 11
- **2023 charge 2** covers old charge #s 1, 3, 4
- **2023 charge 3** covers old charge #s 2, 5
- **2023 charge 4** covers old charge # 1
- **2023 charge 5** covers old charge # 7
- **2023 charge 6** covers old charge #s 9, 10

Thanks,  
Peter LaGoy  
Chair - Trails Coordination and Management Committee
