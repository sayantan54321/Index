## Tax Appeals

On **Table 1**, row 4, the recommendation is to budget $0 for transfers to cover tax appeals. The Town's current tax appeals are primarily against Eversource Energy ($5.7 million). Eversource has not initiated new tax appeals recently, and pending appeals are set for trial before December 1, 2023.

## Conclusion

The Town faces challenges in revenue growth due to external factors affecting property values and local aid. Continued monitoring and strategic planning will be essential to navigate these financial dynamics.
Town's overlay reserve for tax appeals has been built to $7.2M, which exceeds current appeals by $1.5M. Because of this excess, it is reasonable to enter the budget with a $0 contribution to that reserve account budgeted. As the budget process progresses, if the Town prevails as expected in pending tax appeal cases, if Eversource again refrains from filing new tax appeals, or if both occur; consideration will be given to recommending that the Board of Assessors withdraw some amount of funding from the Overlay account and return it to the Town General Fund, where it would be available as a one-time source of funding to support one-time budget needs consistent with Town policy. Resolution of pending tax appeals may be known before December, and information about the status of new tax appeals will be known around February 10, 2024.
