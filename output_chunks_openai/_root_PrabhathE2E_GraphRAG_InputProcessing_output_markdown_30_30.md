There are several potential paths or combination of paths for dealing with the prospective shortfall identified in Table 3:

- Funding requests could be reduced
- Additional revenue could be forthcoming from Commonwealth Local Aid, new growth in the tax base, or another source
- A decision could be made to deviate from Financial Policy and support recurring costs with one-time sources of revenue which may become available (e.g., Certified Free Cash from prior year operations or withdrawals from the tax overlay account if the Town prevails in pending tax litigation with Eversource Energy)
- An override of the tax levy limit of Proposition 2Â½ could be considered
