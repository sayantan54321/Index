To the Hiring Committee,

It is with much enthusiasm that I would like to apply for the position of Grant Coordinator for Hopkinton Youth and Family Services. As the current Interim MassCall3-B Coordinator and previous MassCALL3-A Coordinator/Prevention Coordinator for the Hopkinton Organizing for Prevention (HOP) Coalition, a sector of Hopkinton Youth and Family Services, I bring with me over two years of relevant municipal experience. As a counselor with over 10 years of experience, I have used my skills and abilities to form trusting relationships, manage and evaluate programs, and empower community members.
