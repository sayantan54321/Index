Select Board:

The Trails Coordination and Management Committee (TCMC; Trails Committee) has drafted charges for our committee and for an Upper Charles Trail Building Committee (UCTC) for your consideration. These are attached. Some additional points:

Although we understand that the Board voted to keep the UCTC as a separate committee, we wanted to remind you that we voted unanimously to have that committee be a subcommittee to a single town trails committee. Previously expressed reasons include clarity for the Hopkinton community, with a single trails committee, having an established framework for future work on other similar regional trails, and better communications with the public. On further reflection, we feel that the very nature of the Upper Charles Trail Committee's (UCTC's) work, a small group working with a consultant and focused on an issue, can lead to insular thinking and a disregard of public concerns, as happened with the 2011 Fruit street school building committee and with the UCTC. For these reasons, we continue to feel that a subcommittee may be appropriate.
