# TOWN OF HOPKINTON  
## TOWN MANAGER'S OFFICE  


4. Irrespective of the Select Board’s initial budget development direction, Departments should be aware that if revenue estimates are eventually lower than expected, if deviations from financial policy that allow for spending at the directed level are not supported, if any tax levy override necessary to support operations at target levels is not supported, or if centrally funded Departmental costs, such as Municipal-wide employee health care and benefits, are higher than projected, Departmental budget growth may be constrained below the level noted, irrespective of any initial direction.
5. The Town Manager’s Office will provide budget submission forms to each Department and to relevant boards, committees, and commissions. These submission forms will require narrative connection to the Town’s strategic goals, including goals to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.

6. To support review of the current services and incremental request, all Departments are directed to adopt the summary format developed by the Hopkinton Public Schools, used by all Departments in FY 2023 and FY 2024, framing summary requests in the following format which will be included in the revised budget submission template:

   a. FY 2024 budget  
   b. Less, Efficiencies planned  
   c. Plus, inflationary costs for supplies, services, and contractual and other salary increases  
   d. Plus, new costs for compliance with regulatory or statutory requirements  
   e. Plus, costs related to service expansions related to community growth  
   f. Include relevant metrics to support budget requests  

7. Specific instructions for Departments on FY 2025 procedures for operating budget submissions and capital requests will be forthcoming from my Office.

To be clear, new spending considered in this process will be substantially funded from new growth in the tax base, and any eventual spending proposal that requires property tax revenue in excess of the amount that may be levied within the limits of Proposition 2½ will require a corresponding proposal for a Proposition 2½ tax limit override. Any such proposed override should consider that the taxpayer with an average home valued at $753,300 may also face a peak tax burden of nearly $1,100 if the Elmwood School replacement is approved as presented this Fall as debt to be excluded from the limits of the tax levy, separate and distinct from any other additional excluded debt that may be proposed in the FY 2025 budget cycle.
