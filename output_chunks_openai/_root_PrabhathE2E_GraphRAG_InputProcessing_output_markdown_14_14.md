# 2024 Annual Town Meeting Timeline & FY 25 Budget Calendar
## Timeline
### November 14, 2023


As part of this year’s budget process, I will again be coordinating a series of public listening sessions to discuss ideas about service levels. These ideas may involve diversity, equity, and inclusion; accountability; other long-standing issues; or small capital projects recommended by the community.

A budget advisory group consisting of the Chairs of the Select Board, Appropriation Committee, School Committee, and professional staff will meet regularly with Chairs reporting to their respective boards. I look forward to another successful collaboration for the development of the FY 2025 budget.
