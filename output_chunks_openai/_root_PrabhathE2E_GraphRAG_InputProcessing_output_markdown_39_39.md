MassDOT's Original Completion Date for the Project was October 22, 2023. That date was set at the award of the contract. This date has not yet been changed, but MassDOT has confirmed that a new contract end date will be set; tentatively estimated as July 2024.

Sidewalks are nearing completion, but changes are required in the area in front of the Korean Presbyterian Church (2 Main Street). The area in front of the church should have loam and seed to accommodate trees. The concrete that was poured will need to be removed.

**Traffic Signals at Wood/Main St. and Rte.85/Main** - VHB was onsite to inspect the traffic signals at both intersections and determined that the lights were not set per the design plan. Amorello was notified and the subcontractor was onsite on 9/27/23 to adjust the driveway lights at the Wood Street intersection. As of the date of this report, fixes to the lights at the 85/Main Street intersection are still pending. VHB to provide information.

**Bike Path** - Bike Lane paving (top course) took place on Wednesday, 9/27/23.

**Brick Work** - The Town has provided MassDOT with additional requested information. Additional work on the north side pending approval. MassDOT notified; new approval process needs to be started. MassDOT is working to get the brick work started; dependent on the sub-contractorâ€™s schedule.

**Tree plantings next year;** the Town has requested to hold off.

Verizon is setting poles and was onsite the week of 9/25/23.

No update from Eversource; no idea when transformers will be available. Overhead wire pole transfers on some of the project, following Verizon pole sets.

**Traffic poles and peeling paint.** Update provided at the 10/3 construction meeting. The MassDOT plan is to strip pole and paint in place. The Town of Chelsea is coordinating this application right now. Anthony Tavolone will provide the specific location to the Town so they can visit the site and see the procedure and final product.
